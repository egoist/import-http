## Introduction

- Imports source code URLs! Like `<script type="module">` and [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) but implemented as a webpack/Rollup plugin. Embracing the future :)

  ```js
  import template from 'https://unpkg.com/lodash-es/template'

  console.log(template(`Hello <%= name %>`)({ name: 'EGOIST' }))
  ```

  Remote code is fetched and cached on first build, and never updated until
  you use the `reload` option. See more about [Caching](#caching).

- No more `node_modules` bloat, no dependency to install.

## Install

```bash
yarn add import-http --dev
```

## Usage

### Webpack

In your `webpack.config.js`:

```js
const ImportHttpWebpackPlugin = require('import-http/webpack')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [new ImportHttpWebpackPlugin()]
}
```

That's it, try following code:

```js
import React from 'https://unpkg.com/react'
import Vue from 'https://unpkg.com/vue'

console.log(React, Vue)
```

Run webpack and it just works.

### Rollup

In your `rollup.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  plugins: [require('import-http/rollup')()]
}
```

## Caching

Resources will be fetched at the very first build, then the response will be cached in `~/.cache/import-http` dir. You can use the `reload` option to invalidate cache:

```js
const ImportHttpWebpackPlugin = require('import-http/webpack')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new ImportHttpWebpackPlugin({
      reload: process.env.RELOAD
    })
  ]
}
```

Then run `RELOAD=true webpack` to update cache.
